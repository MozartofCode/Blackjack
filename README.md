# Casino Royale – A Decentralized AI-Powered Blackjack Experience

**Play Blackjack against the house alongside AI-powered bots using advanced decision-making algorithms. This decentralized application (DApp) integrates blockchain-based monetary transactions and AI-driven strategy optimization.**  

## Overview  
Casino Royale is a **decentralized Blackjack experience** where players compete against the house alongside AI-driven bots. The project combines **smart contracts**, **machine learning-based decision-making**, and **blockchain technology** to create a next-generation casino experience.  

## Key Features  
✅ **AI-Powered Bots** – Compete against six different bots powered by **Neural Networks (NN), Reinforcement Learning (RL), Decision Trees, and Random Forests**.  
✅ **Decentralized Blackjack DApp** – Built using Solidity smart contracts, deployed via **Truffle** on a test blockchain using **Ganache**.  
✅ **MVC-Structured Backend** – Clean, scalable, and modularized architecture.  
✅ **React.js Frontend** – Interactive UI for seamless gameplay.  
✅ **Fair & Transparent Transactions** – Smart contracts ensure fair payouts and decentralized casino operations.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Backend:** Solidity (Smart Contracts), Truffle, Ganache, Node.js  
- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **AI Models:** Neural Networks (NN), Reinforcement Learning (RL), Decision Trees, Random Forests  
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum (Testnet), Web3.js  
- **Development Tools:** Python, Java (for early bot development), OpenGameArt (for assets)  

## Game Rules  
Casino Royale follows a structured set of rules inspired by traditional Blackjack:  
1️⃣ Played with **5 standard decks** (52 cards each).  
2️⃣ One **house (dealer) vs. four players** (3 AI bots + 1 human player).  
3️⃣ Blackjack pays **3:2**, as in real casinos.  
4️⃣ **Doubling and re-splitting** after a split are restricted.  
5️⃣ **No insurance bets** (dealer showing an Ace does not allow insurance).  
6️⃣ Dealer must **stand on 17 or above**.  
7️⃣ Minimum bet: **$10**.  
8️⃣ Player can **only Hit or Stand** in the full-stack DApp for simplicity.  
9️⃣ Bots in the CLI version can **Hit, Stand, Double, Split, or Surrender** like in a real casino.  

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup  
### **Backend (Solidity + Smart Contracts) Setup**  
1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MozartofCode/Blackjack-Bot.git
   cd Casino-Royale
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**  
   ```sh
   npm install -g truffle
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start a local blockchain:**  
   ```sh
   ganache-cli
   ```
4. **Deploy the smart contracts:**  
   ```sh
   truffle migrate --reset
   ```

### **Frontend (React.js) Setup**  
1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**  
   ```sh
   cd client
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**  
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the frontend:**  
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

### **Bots & AI Analysis**  
For AI-driven bots and simulations:  
```sh
python bot_analysis.py
```
This script runs AI-powered bots against the house and evaluates profitability based on a **30% profit threshold**.

## AI Bot Analysis  
The AI models are trained to maximize profits using various strategies:  
- **Neural Networks (NN)** – Self-learning bot that adapts based on game outcomes.  
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** – Uses Q-learning to optimize decision-making.  
- **Decision Trees & Random Forests** – Predicts the best moves based on historical game data.  
- **Random Bot** – A baseline comparison using purely random moves.  

Each bot's **win rate and profit percentage** are analyzed over thousands of games to determine the most effective strategy.  

## Future Enhancements  
🔹 Integrate a **Metamask Web3 wallet** for real blockchain transactions.  
🔹 Expand AI strategies with **Deep Q Networks (DQN)**.  
🔹 Implement additional Blackjack features like **splitting, doubling down, and insurance** in the DApp version.  
🔹 Multiplayer support for real-time decentralized gameplay.  

## 🏆 Project Inspiration  
This project was inspired by the movie **"21"**, where a team of MIT students successfully applied card counting strategies to Blackjack. The **initial bot** was built in Java and later evolved into an AI-powered system with advanced ML models.
